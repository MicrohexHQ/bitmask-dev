.. _osx-dev:

Setting up a development environment in OSXâ„¢
============================================

.. note: work in progress

* Make sure you're using a new enough version of pip (1.8 or newest). This will make all the problems with ``cryptography`` going away, since it will install the statically built wheel.

* Use ``brew`` to install ``OpenSSL``.

* **Problem**: pyqt5 in homebrew stopped shipping qtwebkit. I found the following
workaround in an issue in qutebrowser's repo, works fine for me for now::

  cd $(brew --prefix)/Library/Formula
  curl -OO
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew/f802822b0fa35ad362aebd0101ccf83a638bed37/Library/Formula/{py,}qt5.rb
  brew install qt5 pyqt5

.. note: copy that into a makefile target

After those fixes, you should be able to build the bundle::

  make bundle_osx


Privileged helper
=================

The OSX privileged helper is in ``src/leap/bitmask/vpn/helpers/osx/``.

.. note: move it to vpn/helpers/osx

It is a python daemon that runs as root.
It should be installed by the Bitmask installer.

If you have to stop it::

  sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/se.leap.bitmask-helper.plist


And, to load it again::

  sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/se.leap.bitmask-helper.plist


Debugging bitmask-helper
------------------------

Bitmask communicates with the privileged ``bitmask-helper`` through a unix
socket. If you need to debug the privileged helper (for instance, if you need to
tear down the firewall after a crash), you can do it like this with
``socat``::

  echo 'firewall_stop/CMD' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/bitmask-helper.socket


Other helpers
-------------

There are other helpers that the installer drops in a well-know path.
These are shipped in ``pkg/osx``, and copied to
``/Applications/Bitmask.app/Contents/Resources``.


OSX Firewall
------------

The OSX Firewall lives in ``src/leap/bitmask/vpn/helpers/osx/bitmask.pf.conf``. It gets
installed to the same path mentioned in the previous section.

.. note: cleanup unused helpers

Installing the bundle with homebrew
===================================

For testing purposes, `homebrew`_ can be used to distribute and install the
bundle. This should download and install the latest version of the bundle::

  brew install kalikaneko/bitmask/bitmask

After that, you should be able to launch the bundle::

  bitmask


.. _`homebrew`: https://brew.sh/


Debug logs
----------

Bitmask rotates logs. The latest one can be found at::

  /Users/<youruser>/Library/Preferences/leap/bitmaskd.log


Known Issues
------------

The current state of the bundle that is distributed with homebrew is yet buggy,
so it's in a pre-alpha state. Reports or bugfixes are welcome a this point.

Major blockers for a usable homebrew distribution are:

* OpenVPN is launched, but cannnot stopped https://0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-dev/issues/8924
* Cannot find the gpg binary installed by homebrew https://0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-dev/issues/8934


OSX Development Roadmap
=======================

1. Get a smooth 0.10 installation experience for power-users via homebrew.
2. Merge bugfixes.
3. Distribute Bitmask.pkg again, with the installer executing the same
   installation scripts as homebrew Formula is doing.
