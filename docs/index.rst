Bitmask: your internet encryption toolkit
=========================================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>` and :ref:`Known Issues
<issues>`)

What is Bitmask?
-----------------------------------------
**Bitmask** is the client for the services offered by `the LEAP Platform`_.  The
services currently deployed are Encrypted Internet Proxy (VPN) and Encrypted Mail.

Bitmask offers a **command-line interface** and a **multiplatform desktop
client**. It can be also used as a **set of libraries** to communicate with the
different services from third party applications.

Bitmask is written in python using `Twisted`_  and licensed under the `GPL3`_. The
Graphical User Interface is written in html+js and uses `PyQt5`_ for serving the
application.

Understood! Show me the docs!
-----------------------------------------

These documents that you are reading are, mostly, a **guide for developers** that want to contribute to the development of Bitmask, and seek to understand better the code organization and the contribution process.

The **authoritative users guide** lives at `bitmask.net`_.

Other important documents about the LEAP Project can be found at the `Official LEAP documentation`_ site. If you ever need an offline copy, you can clone the `repo for the LEAP Docs site`_. That repo contains also the related LEAP Platform documentation and all the latest design documents. Enhancement contributions and new translations are always welcome! Just open a new merge request.

On the contrary, this developers documentation you are reading right now is maintained in the `bitmask-dev`_ git repo itself, and `can also be checked online`_.

Building the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

if you want to build these docs locally, you can do::

  make doc

from the topmost folder in the `bitmask-dev`_ repo. Note that you need to have sphinx installed.
