Bootstrapping a windows environment for Bitmask development
===========================================================

Create a windows virtual machine. Give it a minimum of 25GB.

Install ansible:

  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/windows_setup.html

TODO: add instructions for configuring inventory in a file in this folder - see hosts.sample
      the other option is to configure it in /etc/ansible/hosts

Install bitmask deps and some tools for development:

  make deps

Reboot the windows machine so that some installed tools get in the PATH for the new session:

  make reboot

Bootstrap a bitmask virtualenv:

  make bootstrap
