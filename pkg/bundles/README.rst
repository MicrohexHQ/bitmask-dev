bundle utilities
----------------
In this folder there are several makefile/batch scripts that are used during
the bundling process.

The bundles are first generated by PyInstaller (using the spec file in
``pkg/pyinst``), and then we arrange the various helpers in a way that is
specific to every platform.

The scripts in this folder are expected to be called from the root folder of
the project, and therefore all the paths are relative paths to the root folder.
